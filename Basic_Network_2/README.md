# Network fundamentals

## Description
This lab demonstrates the configuration of a simple network divided into multiples subnets and Vlans.

## Topology
- 2 Router
- 3 Switches
- 12 EndPoints

## Technologies Used
- Static routing
- Subnetting
  - FLSM
- VLAN
  - Inter-VLAN routing
  - VTP

## Verification
- EndPoints in the same subnet and VLAN can communicate
- EndPoints in different subnets and VLANs can communicate through the router
